# EMOTION-AI

Breakthrough in Emotion Artificial Intelligence has copletely changed the art of Computer Vision.This will be clearly
shown by the Source code I created which detects Facial keypoints and shows the exact emotion of people with high accuracy.

My Inspiration came from the biggest start up Emotion AI company called affectiva that leverages the power of AI to create emotion AI
models. For more information, [VISIT HERE](https://www.affectiva.com/)

### I have Used state of the art RESBLOCKS to create a powerful model for the AI

## RESBLOCK ARCHITECTURE

#### The code architecture clearly demonstrated in the Jupyter Nook

Dependencies:
  ```python
     pip install cv2
     pip install tensorflow
   ```

## FACIAL KEYPOINTS LOSS CURVE AFTER 500 EPOCHS

The loss seems to decreasing significantly and overfitting of the model is properly regulated after 500 epochs

## FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ON LOSS AND ACCURACY CURVE
The model is able to have a significant loss through the training Process

The accuracy of the model increases significantly after 50 epochs of training the data

This is shown by the high accuracy achieved on the test data

![ACCURACY](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71969710/135448965-d39d44f5-a705-4471-babd-b7512055d176.JPG)
           
 After testing the model on data it has never seen. The model was able to achieve a significanly high accuracy as demonstrated below

### Practical results after training the model :

### The Convoluted output is demonstrated below:

 ## COMBINATION RESULT OF FACAL KEYPOINTS AND FACIAL EXPRESSIONS

 From the above model. It is clearly shown that Artificial intelligence has played a significant role in the field of Computer vision.
